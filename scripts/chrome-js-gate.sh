# The two chrome-UI release gates, as one command that either passes or fails.
#
# GATE 1: every chrome script must LOAD. `node --check` validates syntax and
# nothing else, and that gap has already shipped a defect: a splice script
# dropped thirteen top-level declarations, chrome.js threw a ReferenceError at
# load, and two toolbar buttons were dead in a build whose JS parsed perfectly.
# So this EXECUTES each file against a DOM stub.
#
# GATE 2: no innerHTML anywhere in the chrome. The chrome webview is the one
# holding IPC and vault access, so markup injection there reads the vault.
# Peer strings and page titles reach that DOM through textContent only.
#
# The harness used to live in a scratch directory outside the repository,
# which meant the gate could not be re-run by anyone else and was, in
# practice, one machine's habit. Same lesson as smoke.sh silently running a
# stale binary: a check nobody else can run is not a check.
