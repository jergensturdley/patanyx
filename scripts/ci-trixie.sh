# THE CONTENT-FILTER ENGINE GATE.
#
# Asks THIS IMAGE'S WebKit whether the shipped ad and tracker rules actually
# compile. Everything above proves our code is self-consistent; this proves the
# engine accepts what we intend to ship to users.
#
# It exists because the failure it catches is SILENT. WebKit refuses a compiled
# rule list above an undocumented ceiling -- measured 2026-09-01 as exactly
# 150,000 rules on both 2.50.6 and 2.52.6 -- and refuses patterns outside the
# subset its regex engine accepts. Either refusal installs NO filter, and the
# browser then runs with ad blocking switched on in the UI and nothing actually
# blocking. Nothing in the product notices.
#
# A build-time assertion against the constant 150000 would only restate today's
# number: if a future engine LOWERS the ceiling or narrows the accepted
# patterns, the constant still passes and the release ships broken. Asking the
# engine is the only check that survives the engine changing, which is the
