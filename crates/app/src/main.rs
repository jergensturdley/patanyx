//! PATANYX Browser — tao event loop and the chrome webview setup.
//!
//! Security invariants enforced here:
//!   * the `rbchrome` custom protocol, the IPC handler, and all
//!     `evaluate_script` calls exist ONLY on the chrome webview;
//!   * the chrome webview may only navigate to its own origin; the origin's
//!     URL form is platform-specific (see platform::CHROME_ORIGIN_PREFIX);
//!   * content webviews (one per tab, built in state.rs) may only navigate
//!     to http/https/about:blank, may not open new windows (http/https
//!     targets open in a background tab instead), and have no custom
//!     protocol and no IPC.
//!
//! KNOWN LIMIT, stated because the invariant above would otherwise overclaim:
//! the scheme allowlist covers TOP-LEVEL navigation only on Windows. wry drives
//! it from WebView2's `NavigationStarting`, which does not fire for subframes,
//! and does not use `FrameNavigationStarting`. So an iframe inside a page is not
//! filtered by us there. The dangerous cases are still closed by the engine
//! itself (file:// is refused from an http origin, and the chrome origin in a
//! content webview has no custom protocol registered so it reaches only the
//! network), but this is engine behaviour rather than something we enforce.
//! Closing it properly needs a frame-aware hook wry does not currently expose.
//!
//! The same missing frame information cuts the other way on WebKitGTK, where
//! the navigation handler DOES fire for subframes. That is why the displayed URL
//! and history are driven from the page-load handler rather than from the
//! navigation handler; see the comment in state.rs::build_tab.
//!
//! All platform-specific window/webview glue lives in `platform`; this file
//! and the other modules are cfg-free.
