  // The chrome is its own OS window, `closedChromePx()` tall, sitting above a
  // separate window that holds the page. Anything the chrome draws below that
  // height is outside its own rect and simply does not exist on screen -- the
  // two windows are siblings and do not composite. So every surface that wants
  // to be taller than the strip has to ask Rust to grow the chrome to the full
  // window first. That is not a visual nicety; without it the menu sheet would
  // render into a 148px slot and be clipped after its second row.
  //
  // Coverage is COMPUTED in one place rather than toggled by callers. The
  // menu sheet that once shared this decision is gone (toolbar-gate asserts
  // so), but the shape stays: two callers each deciding independently is how
  // you get a dismissal that uncovers the window while a panel is still
  // open, leaving that panel drawn into the strip and cut in half.
  //
  // The last-sent value is remembered so a hand-over does not emit a redundant
  // uncover/recover pair, which on Windows is a visible flicker of the page.
  //
  // A panel is a CENTERED CARD, always. It was briefly a right-docked pane
  // (2026-07-31, one build): that hijacked the Split arrangement
  // reserved for chat -- a docked chat and a docked panel would have fought
  // over one pane -- and the geometry was rejected on sight. Split
  // remains chat's; panels cover the window and say so.
  //
  // What DOES vary is the backdrop. Where the backend can lift a transparent
  // chrome above live content (Windows -- see `chrome_caps`), the page stays
  // rendered at its normal rect and the scrim is genuinely translucent: a
  // dimmed, still-playing page behind the card. Everywhere else the page gets
  // a zero rect and the scrim is solid, because siblings that cannot
  // composite must not fake a see-through.
  let chromeCovered = null;
  // One round trip carrying everything the chrome must know before it paints.
  //
  // `page_covers_chrome` is the other half of the backdrop question above,
  // and it decides how tall a modal card may be: where the chrome is NOT
  // lifted, the page covers everything the chrome is not using, so a card
  // sized against the viewport extends underneath it and its lower half is
  // simply not on screen -- with no scrollbar, because as far as the
  // document is concerned it fits.
  //

  // then rearrange itself. Falls back to its own get if a reply arrives

  // Not replaced with a contents-generation counter, because the thing it was

  // it unreferenced and fails -- which is how it catches wording that was
