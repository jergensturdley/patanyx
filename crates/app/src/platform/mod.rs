//! Platform abstraction over the two webview backends.
//!
//! Everything GTK/WebKitGTK (unix) or WebView2/child-window (Windows)
//! specific lives in the per-platform module re-exported here, so main.rs,
//! state.rs and ipc.rs stay free of `#[cfg]`. Both modules expose the same
//! surface: `Hosts`/`TabView`, chrome/content webview construction, tab
//! show/hide/remove, chrome height, layout, and the privacy controls
//! (per-tab `TabPolicy`, network+cosmetic ad blocking, network freeze with
//! ledger, quarantine preset, TLS-interception state).
//!
//! The engine-free half of the privacy features — rule matching, ledger
//! accounting, the freeze state machine, TLS issuer classification, and the
//! platform-neutral API types — lives in `privacy`. It is pure code with
//! unit tests, because `cargo test` must be able to prove the security
//! properties (a blocked request never leaves the machine, freezing is
//! per-tab and reversible) without a display. The backends only adapt
//! engine callbacks to those functions.

/// forgetting `shop.example.com` would have deleted a cookie belonging only
/// to `example.com` -- reaching outside the site the person named, which is
/// the one thing a per-site clear must never do.
///
/// So: a leading dot means subdomains are included, and no leading dot means
/// this host and no other. Either way the suffix must fall on a label

/// a URI query would have. Widening that is a product decision about what
/// "this site" means, not a bug fix.
///
/// THE TRAILING DOT IS TRIMMED ON PURPOSE, and a review round three raised it
/// as a possible over-match: `foo.com.` and `foo.com` are distinct strings in
/// the cookie store, so trimming merges two scopes the store keeps apart.
/// Kept anyway, because in DNS they are the same name -- the trailing dot is
