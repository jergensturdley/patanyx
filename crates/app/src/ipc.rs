/// reached, and no argument extractor applies a length check, so without a cap
/// here the memory ceiling for a single command is whatever the chrome origin
/// cares to send. That is a bound worth having even though the chrome is the
/// trusted side: this boundary exists precisely to survive the chrome being
/// wrong.

///
/// The vault auto-lock exists to protect an unattended machine, so it needs to
/// distinguish "somebody is using this browser" from "the browser is talking to
/// itself". Every frame used to count, and some frames are sent on a timer:
///
///   * `tab_ledger` is polled every 2.5 seconds for as long as the Tab Activity
///     panel is open. That alone re-armed the deadline twenty-four times a
///     minute, so opening that panel and walking away disabled the auto-lock
///     entirely -- silently, with nothing on screen saying the vault would now
///     stay open indefinitely.
///   * `update_status` is polled while an install runs.
///   * `ping`, `ocr_status`, `blocklist_status` and `resolver_status` are fired
///     by the chrome as it loads, before the user has done anything at all.
///
/// The decision is made HERE, by command name, rather than by letting the
/// chrome flag its own frames as background. The chrome is trusted, but a rule
/// it has to remember to apply is a rule that gets forgotten the next time
/// somebody adds a poller -- and the failure is invisible, because a vault that
/// never locks looks exactly like a vault that has not locked yet.
/// Why `cred_autofill_offer_get` returned what it returned.
///
/// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO FIX. The reply used to be `items` alone, and an
/// empty list meant FOUR different things: the host had no origin for the
/// active tab, no vault had ever been created, the vault was LOCKED, or a real
/// search ran and matched nothing. The chrome could not tell them apart, so it
/// said the only thing it knew how to say -- "No saved password for this site."
/// Three quarters of the time that was a claim it had no basis for: with a
/// locked vault nothing had been searched at all. A tester whose password was
/// saved correctly was told it was not there, and reasonably concluded the
/// browser had lost it.
///
/// Only `no-match` asserts that a search happened and came back empty. The
/// other three say, in the surface's own words, that no search was made.
///
/// The ORIGIN weighed here is the host's, not the chrome's. Both derive it
/// with `host_of`, but the chrome's copy rides a status event that can be a
/// navigation stale, and this answer has to describe the lookup that actually
/// ran, not the one the chrome believes it asked for.
/// The field `cred_autofill_offer_get` carries its reason in.
///
/// A CONTRACT WITH chrome.js, so it is spelled once here rather than twice in
/// two files that cannot see each other. `the_chrome_reads_every_reason_this_
/// arm_can_send` fails if either side renames or stops handling one, which is
/// the failure this whole change exists to prevent: the chrome silently
/// falling back to "No saved password for this site" because the answer it
